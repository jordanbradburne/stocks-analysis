## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose and background are well defined 

### Background
The purpose of this project is to use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Excel to help out my friend Steve who just graduated with a finance degree. His parents decide to be his first clients and want to invest in some sort of green energy. They haven't done too much research, so Steve's Parents decide to invest their money into DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) who basically make silicon wafers for solar pannels.

### Purpose
Steve makes a promise to look into DAQO, but feels that they may need to diversify their funds. So he wants to analyze different green energy stocks, as well as DAQO stock. Steve has given me an excel file that has all of the data he needs me to analyze. Using VBA, I can create code to help Steve analyze any stock without much error.
